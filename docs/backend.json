This approach simplifies querying and avoids unnecessary complexity. Each movie document contains all the necessary information, including title, description, genre, release year, poster, and creation timestamp. Authentication is handled by Firebase Auth, which is sufficient for basic user management in this context. This design prioritizes simplicity and ease of management for a movie management system."
